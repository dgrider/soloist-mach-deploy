Recipes to install commonly used applications on OS X

### WARNING

To make maintaining Sprout a little easier, we are no longer adding recipes to this cookbook when a Homebrew [Formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/) or [Cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) is available and no additional steps are needed for installation. Please explore using homebrew with [sprout-homebrew](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-homebrew) where possible.
